# SwEng Group 30

## Setup
Make sure you have [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) installed. Set your working directory to the root of the repository and run the following command:
```bash
docker compose build && docker compose up && docker compose rm -fsv
```
This will build and run the SwEng Group 30 project.
Added docker rm to clean up the images after stopping containers.
